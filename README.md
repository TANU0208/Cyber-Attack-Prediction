# Cyber-Attack-Prediction
Modern water distribution systems rely on computers, sensors and actuators for both monitoring and operational purposes. This combination of physical processes and embedded systems—cyber-physical systems, in short—improves the level of service of water distribution networks but exposes them to the potential threats of cyber attacks. We will be using statistical models to attempt to detect cyber attacks.
